Produce a shiny app to explore the number of graduates per program.

File **0_data_prep_script.R** handles data download and pre-processing.  Data will be downloaded into (and later sourced from) a directory called **filecache**.
Data is publically available via StatCan and updated annually, so use the script to acquire the latest dataset.

I'll put a rendered version online shortly
